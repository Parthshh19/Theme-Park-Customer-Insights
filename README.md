# Theme Park Reviews Analysis

**Problem Definition in Business Terms:**

The aim of this project is to analyze customer reviews from three major theme park branches (California, Paris, and Hong Kong) to understand visitor demographics, peak visiting times, overall sentiments, and specific concerns or interests. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize marketing strategies, and improve overall park operations.

**Proposed Approaches:**



1.   Data Exploration: Analyzing visitor demographics and peak visiting times for each branch.
2.   Sentiment Analysis: Assessing overall customer sentiments towards the theme parks and specifically their services.
3.   Topic Modeling: Identifying and interpreting key concerns and interests of customers using LDA.

**Major Findings:**

*  Visitor Demographics: California predominantly attracts visitors from the United States, while Hong Kong has a more diverse visitor base from neighboring Asian countries, and Paris draws many visitors from the United Kingdom.

*  Visiting Patterns: Domestic visitors peak during summer (June and July), while international visitors peak in late summer and early fall (August and September) in California.

*  Sentiments: Hong Kong received the most positive overall sentiments, while California was praised the most for its services.

*  Customer Concerns: Key concerns include accessibility, employee interactions, and basic amenities like toilets and dining options.


These findings help address the business problem by providing insights into visitor behavior and preferences, enabling targeted improvements in marketing, customer service, and operational efficiency.

**Recommendations for Business Improvement:**

1. **Targeted Marketing:**
   - California: Focus marketing efforts on the U.S. audience, emphasizing summer promotions.
   - Hong Kong: Develop campaigns targeting diverse Asian countries, highlighting accessibility and diverse attractions.
   - Paris: Strengthen ties with U.K. visitors, promoting unique European experiences and convenient travel packages.

2. **Operational Adjustments:**
   - **Peak Season Management:** Prepare for increased domestic visitor traffic during summer, and international traffic in late summer and early fall in California. This involves staff scheduling, inventory management, and capacity planning.
   - **Accessibility Enhancements:** Invest in improving accessibility features, particularly in Hong Kong and Paris, to address the needs of visitors with disabilities.
   - **Service Training:** Enhance employee training programs to improve interactions, as customer satisfaction is closely linked to staff behavior.

3. **Customer Experience Improvements:**
   - **Facility Upgrades:** Prioritize maintenance and upgrades of basic amenities like toilets and dining areas to meet customer expectations, particularly in Hong Kong and Paris.
   - **Special Events and Reservations:** Promote advance reservations and special event planning to cater to visitors' interest in organized visits and celebrations, especially in California.

By implementing these recommendations, the theme parks can enhance visitor satisfaction, attract more diverse demographics, and optimize operations for peak seasons, ultimately driving higher customer loyalty and business growth.
